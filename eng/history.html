    <p>OVHcloud, formerly known as OVH (On Vous HÃ©berge), is a French cloud services company founded in 1999 by Octave Klaba. OVHcloud has grown to become a major global player in cloud computing, dedicated servers and hosting. Here is an overview of the company's history, from its foundation to its evolution as a leader in the cloud:</p>
  <h1>1. Foundation and early years (1999-2005)</h1>
    <p> OVH was founded in Roubaix by Octave Klaba, an engineer of Polish origin, with the idea of providing low-cost web hosting solutions. From the outset, the company distinguished itself by manufacturing its own servers, which enabled it to significantly reduce its costs and offer competitive rates. OVH began to expand in France and then throughout Europe, with strong growth in its customer base.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>2. European and international expansion (2006-2015)</h2>
    <P>Over the years, OVH has continued to grow in France and other European countries. The company diversified by offering a wider range of services, including dedicated servers, shared hosting services, domains and VoIP telephony solutions. In 2006, OVH reached a major milestone by exceeding 30,000 servers in its data centres. The company also opened its first data centre outside France, in Canada (Beauharnois, Quebec).
During this period, OVH builds its own global fibre optic network, giving it greater control over the infrastructure and connectivity of its services.</P>
    <br>
    <h3>3.Transition to the cloud and innovation (2016-2019) </h3>
    <p>With cloud computing taking off on a global scale, OVH decided to invest heavily in this technology. In 2016, the company raised â‚¬250 million to finance its international expansion and accelerate its development in the cloud. At the same time, OVH also revised its strategy, offering public, private and hybrid cloud solutions to compete with giants such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud.
The company is adopting the name OVHcloud in 2019 to better reflect its positioning in the cloud market. It stands out in particular for its complete control of the production chain (from hardware to services) and its commitment to digital sovereignty, guaranteeing its European customers that their data is hosted in compliance with European regulations such as the RGPD.</p>
